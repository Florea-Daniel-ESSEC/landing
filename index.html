 	<h2>Who am I?</h2>
 	<p>My name is Daniel and I am a student who loves to travel, read news, debate, and enjoy tech. I plan to write on this blog regularly so that I can look back on my past in a fun way. Feel free to take travel advise, interesting topics or whatever else you feel is worth your time out of this page!</p>
